## Installation

### NPM Installation
```sh
npm install -g @metaplex-foundation/cli
```

### Development Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/cli.git
cd cli
npm install
npm run build
npm run mplx
```

When running the development installation, you can use the `npm run mplx <command>` command to start the CLI.

## Quick Start

This CLI is designed to be used with multiple RPCs and wallets. Here's how to get started:

### 1. Configure Your Environment

#### RPC Configuration
```sh
# Add a new RPC
mplx config rpcs add rpc1 https://my-custom-rpc.com/rpc

# List all RPCs
mplx config rpcs list

# Switch active RPC
mplx config rpcs set

? Select an RPC (Use arrow keys)
❯ rpc1                 https://my-custom-rpc.com/rpc123456789
  rpc2                 https://my-custom-rpc.com/rpc987654321
```

#### Wallet Configuration
```sh
# Add a new wallet
mplx config wallets add wallet1 ./path/to/keypair.json

# List all wallets
mplx config wallets list

# Switch active wallet
mplx config wallets set wallet1

? Select a wallet: (Use arrow keys)
❯ wallet1    address...
  wallet2    address...
```

### 2. Create Your First Assets

#### Create a Collection
```sh
# Create with metadata URI
mplx core collection create --name "My Collection" --uri "https://example.com/collection-metadata.json"

# Or create with local files
mplx core collection create --files --image ./image.png --json ./collection-metadata.json

# Generate template files
mplx core collection template
```

#### Create an Asset
```sh
# Create with metadata URI
mplx core asset create --name "My Asset" --uri "https://example.com/metadata.json"

# Or create with local files
mplx core asset create --files --image ./image.png --json ./metadata.json

# Generate template files
mplx core asset template
```

#### Create a Token
```sh
# Interactive token creation
mplx toolbox token create --wizard

# Or create with specific parameters
mplx toolbox token create \
  --name "My Token" \
  --symbol "TOKEN" \
  --decimals 9 \
  --image ./token-logo.png \
  --mint 1000000000
```

## Candy Machine Quick Start

The CLI now features a powerful, user-friendly Candy Machine wizard for creating and managing NFT drops:

```sh
mplx cm create --wizard
```

**Wizard Highlights:**
- Guided prompts for directory, assets, collection, guards, and groups
- Automatic asset discovery and validation with actionable error messages
- Progress indicators for uploads, creation, and insertion
- File overwrite protection and abort support at every step
- Smart asset cache reuse and reload options
- Detailed completion summary with next steps

**Example Output:**
```
